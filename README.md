**Automate data extraction from the Orbis webpage on Google Chrome. Account from Dartmouth's library. Takes in a list of firm names as input.
Orbis cannot handle too many successive queries, so firm names are broken into ~150 name groups. 
Selects variables on firm size and other general info. Saves df as firm{input_file_num}_{group_num}.xls.
Also saves the list of names found to the orbis profile for easy access later.
