**Automate data extraction from the Orbis webpage on Google Chrome. Account from Dartmouth's library. Takes in a list of firm names as input.
Orbis cannot handle too many successive queries, so firm names are broken into ~150 name groups. 
Selects variables on firm size and other general info. Need to stitch the data together, manually or can add an extra function to append.
Also saves the list of names found to the orbis profile for easy access later.
